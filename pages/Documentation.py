     The genetic algorithm is a class of stochastic, parallel search heuristics method for solving both constrained and unconstrained optimization problems that is based on natural selection  and evolution. 
     It's a search technique that can find approximate or exact solutions to optimization and search problems.            
                
    **Genetic Algorithms (GAs)** mimic natural selection, evolving solutions over generations through selection, crossover, and mutation.    These are particularly effective for **multi-objective problems** where trade-offs must be considered.
    
    
    The simulated evolution of the population goes as follows:
    
        1. Generation of the initial population: Start with a random population of solutions 
        
        2. Repeat until some user specified criterion or a certain number of generations have been exceeded:
        Evaluate each solution's fitness, or how well it solves the problem 
        
        - Evaluation of the individuals by applying the objective score (fitness function)

        - Selection of one or more parent individuals

        - Application of genetic operators to build the next generation population
        
            Mutation: Randomly change the genetic information of some individuals 
            Crossover: Swap genetic material between individuals 
            Selection: Only allow the fittest individuals to survive and reproduce
        
Key concepts: 
- Genetic diversity: Mutation and crossover help maintain genetic diversity within the population.
- Fitness: The algorithm favors solutions with higher fitness values.
- Termination condition: The algorithm may terminate when it reaches a desired fitness level or exceeds a specified number of iterations.

        st.markdown("""
        **NSGA-II** is one of the most widely used **Pareto-based** evolutionary algorithms for multi-objective optimization.
         It effectively finds a set of diverse Pareto optimal solutions by employing a non-dominated sorting approach, making it particularly useful for problems with multiple conflicting objectives where you need to find a range of good solutions rather than just one "best" solution; 
         
         - **Princples**:
            - Uses **fast non-dominated sorting** to classify solutions.
            - Implements **crowding distance** to maintain diversity.
            - Preserves **elitism**, ensuring high-quality solutions persist.
         
         Key points about NSGA-II:
        - Multi-objective optimization:
        Designed to solve problems with multiple objectives that might contradict each other, aiming to find a set of solutions that represent the best trade-offs between these objectives. 
        - Non-dominated sorting:
        The core mechanism where solutions are ranked based on their dominance relationships, meaning a solution is considered better than another if it is not dominated by it in any objective. 
        - Crowding distance:
        A metric used to maintain diversity within a non-dominated front, ensuring that solutions across the entire Pareto front are represented. 
        - Elitism:
        Retains the best solutions from the previous generation to guide the search towards better solutions. 
        - Genetic operators:
        Uses standard genetic operators like crossover and mutation to generate new solutions and explore the search space.

        - **Specializations**:
            - Handles **nonlinear and non-convex** optimization problems.
            - Provides **well-distributed Pareto fronts**.
            - Suitable for problems with **many conflicting objectives**.

        - **Application to PEM Electrolyzers**:
            - Identifies optimal trade-offs between **efficiency, cost, and environmental impact**.
            - Helps in refining **electrode materials and structure**.

    with st.expander(" üîµ MOEA/D (Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithm based on Decomposition)"):
        st.markdown("""
        **MOEA/D** decomposes a **multi-objective problem** into **multiple single-objective subproblems**, solving them concurrently.
        It solves multi-objective problems by dividing the original complex problem into a set of simpler, scalarized subproblems which are then optimized simultaneously, effectively allowing the algorithm to find a diverse set of near-optimal solutions along the Pareto front.
        It breaks down a multi-objective problem into smaller, more manageable single-objective problems that can be solved collaboratively to approximate the best possible solutions across all objectives. 
            
        Key concepts
        - Decomposition approach:
            The core idea is to decompose the multi-objective problem into multiple single-objective subproblems using weight vectors, which guide the search towards different parts of the Pareto optimal set. 
        - Neighboring information:
            Each subproblem interacts with its neighboring subproblems to maintain diversity and explore the solution space effectively. 
        - Scalarization:
            Each subproblem is transformed into a single-objective problem using a scalarization function (like weighted sum or Tchebycheff) based on its assigned weight vector. 
        ![MOEA/D](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0360835222004302-gr2.jpg)
            
        - **How It Works**:
            1. Initialize population:
            Generate a population of solutions and assign weight vectors to each individual. 
            2. Decomposition:
            For each individual, calculate its corresponding scalarized objective function using the assigned weight vector. 
            3. Evolutionary process:
            Selection: Select individuals based on their performance in the scalarized objective function. 
            Variation: Apply genetic operators like crossover and mutation to generate new offspring. 
            Update population: Update the population by incorporating new offspring, often using a neighborhood-based mechanism to maintain diversity. 

        - **Specializations**:
            - More efficient for **large-scale optimization problems**.
            - Provides **better diversity control** than NSGA-II.
            - Suitable for cases where **objectives have different scales**.
            
            - Efficient handling of complex problems:
            By decomposing the problem, MOEA/D can tackle multi-objective optimization problems with a large number of objectives or complex constraints. 
            - Good diversity:
            The use of weight vectors helps to maintain diversity in the population, ensuring a good spread of solutions across the Pareto front. 
            - Computational efficiency:
            Compared to other multi-objective algorithms, MOEA/D can often be computationally efficient due to its decomposition approach

        - **Application to PEM Electrolyzers**:
            - Allows **customized weighting** for different trade-offs.
            - Supports **fine-tuning of PEM electrolyzer operational parameters**.

        **SPEA2** improves upon earlier Pareto-based methods by enhancing solution diversity and robustness.
          It approximats the Pareto-optimal set for multiobjective optimization problems. This is an improved version of the original SPEA algorithm, incorporating a more refined fitness assignment strategy and density estimation techniques to achieve better diversity in the solution set.
             
         Key ponts about SPEA2:
        - Pareto-based:
        It aims to identify the Pareto optimal front, which represents the set of solutions that cannot be improved in any objective without worsening another.    
        - Fitness assignment:
        SPEA2 uses a sophisticated fitness calculation that considers both dominance relationships and the density of solutions in the objective space, ensuring a good balance between convergence and diversity. 
        - Archive management:
        A key component of SPEA2 is a non-dominated archive that stores the best solutions found so far, which is updated and truncated to maintain a diverse set of non-dominated solutions.

        - **How It Works**:
            - Assigns **fitness scores** based on Pareto dominance.
            - Uses **density estimation** to avoid overcrowding.
            - Maintains an **external archive** of optimal solutions.
